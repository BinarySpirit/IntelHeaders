Intel Structures and constants

How many times did you have to copy structures/constants 
from Intel PDFs and/or other specs? If your answer is more than once, 
then this project is for you!

We at Viral Security Group work closely with the 
Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual 
on a daily basis, and we had to copy things from it countless times, no more!

The goal of this project is to define all the Intel structures/constants in one place.

We are happy to accept contibutions, just make sure you follow the code conventions, 
specify in a comment from where you got the structures/constant and of course add 
yourself to the contibuters.txt file :)
